    <h2>Messaging teacher</h2>
    <p>If you are not coming to school, make sure to get your parents to send a message via WhatsApp to the teacher before 9:30AM that same day otherwise you will be considered skipping school.</p>
    <p>Note: Make sure it's your parents that send the message, not you!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Letter</h2>
    <p>You should also give a letter to the teacher as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>The letter must be in A4 size and nothing else</p>
    <p>If you are sick, please paste the MC on the same paper for the letter.</p>
    <p>If you didn't go see a doctor and don't have an MC, idk.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Format:</h2>
    <p>I don't know yet, wait till the teacher gives us the format.</p>
